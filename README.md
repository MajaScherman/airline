Instructions: How to run the database.

1.Open up MS SQL server

2.Run create.sql

3.Run insert.sql

4.Run questions.sql

Explaination:

I have built a database for a imaginary airline. 
The motivation for how I designed the structure for this database was a customer story about what was needed so I specified it exactly after the given story.
The project consists of three scripts that you can run in MS SQL server.
First you run create.sql to create the database then insert.sql to insert exampel data. Then run questions.sql which contains queries to get up some tables to look at some of the data.
A cool thing you can do is to use SQL server management studio to draw a database diagram of the database so you easily can view the ER-diagram with keys clearly marked.

Have fun! :D


### About this project  
Here I have designed and built a database for an airline company. It is complete with tables I would believe suitible for an airline company, with information insertable and several queries of interest for using the system. In this project I have explored the complexity in designing databases.
