Instructions: How to run the database.

1.Open up MS SQL server

2.Run create.sql

3.Run insert.sql

4.Run questions.sql

Explaination:

I have built a database for a imaginary airline. 
The motivation for how I designed the structure for this database was a customer story about what was needed so I specified it exactly after the given story.
The project consists of three scripts that you can run in MS SQL server.
First you run create.sql to create the database then insert.sql to insert exampel data. Then questions.sql which contains queries to get up some tables to look at some of the data.

Have fun! :D
